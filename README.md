Expense Tracker was created to keep track of your day-to-day expenses. This app collects data such as the description, 
date and location of where the expense was spent, and are then passed on to the database. The back-end of this application 
was implemented with Spring Boot, a Java-based Framework. The app was created using the Repository Design Pattern.
The programming logic was divided into three interconnecting elements, the model, controller, and repository.
The model and the view is where the application manages the data logic and represent the data visualisation of these data in the
program. However, the main component of the back-end of this app is the controller. This is where data flows in and out of the 
application, and where the application manages all GET, POST, and DELETE requests of the client.

React.js was chosen to be the framework to implement the front-end of the application, because of its ability to handle state changes
of each component independently.
